Covid 19 to my butt
=============

Tired of all of the nonstop pandemic related headlines all over the place?

A Chrome extension that coverts Covid 19 and pandemic related words to "My Butt".
Created this from the fork of [fork of cloud to butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt)

If you want to install it, please follow this [instruction](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9931906/crx-file-install-in-chrome)


Acknowledgments: I truly understand how serious the outbreak is, and the reason I choose to make this is to only ease the current perception of the world. I believe most of us had enough of the media saturation when we use chrome. And this can just lift a bit of mood across me browsing the web.
